  participant PeerA as ðŸŸ¢ Peer A (Offerer)
  participant WS as ðŸ§  WebSocket Server
  participant PeerB as ðŸ”µ Peer B (Answerer)

  Note over PeerA, PeerB: Both peers connect to the server via WebSocket<br>and join the same room (e.g., roomId: "alpha123")

  PeerA->>WS: CONNECT /ws?roomId=alpha123&clientId=peerA
  PeerB->>WS: CONNECT /ws?roomId=alpha123&clientId=peerB

  Note over PeerA: Peer A creates WebRTC offer

  PeerA->>WS: SEND { type: "offer", from: "peerA", to: "peerB", data: {sdp...} }
  WS->>PeerB: FORWARD { type: "offer", from: "peerA", data: {sdp...} }

  PeerB->>WS: SEND { type: "answer", from: "peerB", to: "peerA", data: {sdp...} }
  WS->>PeerA: FORWARD { type: "answer", from: "peerB", data: {sdp...} }

  Note over PeerA, PeerB: ICE candidates exchanged next

  PeerA->>WS: SEND { type: "ice-candidate", from: "peerA", to: "peerB", data: {candidate...} }
  WS->>PeerB: FORWARD { type: "ice-candidate", from: "peerA", data: {candidate...} }

| Concept      | Summary                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `room.go`    | Used for **initial room creation and client setup via REST**. It mutates the same `hub.Rooms` but does not handle live signaling.          |
| `hub.run()`  | Central event loop managing **live WebSocket clients** using Go channels. It handles real-time message routing, registration, and cleanup. |
| Shared State | Both REST and WebSocket flows operate on the same `hub.Rooms` map â€” but for **different purposes**.                                        |
| Lifecycle    | REST flow prepares the room; WS flow handles signaling within the room.                                                                    |
| Channels     | `Register` and `Unregister` manage connection lifecycle. `Broadcast` handles real-time message delivery.                                   |
